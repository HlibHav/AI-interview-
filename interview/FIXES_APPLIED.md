# Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Redirect Issue After Permission Grant
**Problem:** After granting camera/microphone permissions, participants were being redirected to the admin home page instead of staying on the interview page.

**Root Cause:** The `handleDisconnect` function in `app/respondent/page.tsx` was redirecting to `/` with `window.location.href = "/"`.

**Solution:** Updated `handleDisconnect` to reset the state without redirecting:
```typescript
const handleDisconnect = () => {
  setIsConnected(false);
  setPermissionsGranted(false);
  setShowEmailInput(true);
  // Don't redirect to home, stay on respondent page for restart
};
```

**Result:** Participants now stay on the interview page and can restart if needed.

### 2. ✅ Weaviate Environment Variable
**Problem:** Weaviate was throwing errors:
```
API Key: no api key found neither in request header: X-Openai-Api-Key 
nor in environment variable under OPENAI_APIKEY
```

**Root Cause:** Weaviate expects `OPENAI_APIKEY` (no underscore) but most services use `OPENAI_API_KEY` (with underscore).

**Solution:** Updated `env.example` to document both variables:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_APIKEY=your_openai_api_key_here  # Weaviate requires this spelling
```

**Action Required:** Add `OPENAI_APIKEY` to your `.env.local` file with the same value as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

**Result:** Weaviate vector search will work properly for context retrieval during interviews.

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Interview Flow
1. Visit admin dashboard: http://localhost:3000/admin
2. Create research goal and generate script
3. Click "Approve & Generate Link"
4. Copy interview link
5. Open link in new browser/incognito
6. Enter email and click "Start Interview"
7. Grant camera/microphone permissions
8. **✅ Verify:** You should stay on the interview page (not redirect to admin)
9. **✅ Verify:** LiveKit room should initialize
10. **✅ Verify:** Beyond Presence avatar should load

### Test 2: Weaviate Integration
1. After adding `OPENAI_APIKEY` to `.env.local`
2. Restart the server
3. Create a new research goal
4. Go through clarification process
5. **✅ Verify:** No Weaviate errors in terminal
6. **✅ Verify:** Script generation completes successfully
7. **✅ Verify:** Similar responses are retrieved for context
